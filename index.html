						Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is a critical measure in understanding and managing one's health and fitness. It represents the minimum amount of energy, in calories, that an individual needs to sustain basic
						physiological functions while at rest. These functions include breathing, circulation, cell production, nutrient processing, and maintaining body temperature. Essentially, BMR is the energy expenditure of an
						individual in a state of complete rest, providing a foundation upon which additional activities and nutritional needs can be calculated.
					</p>
					<p>
						Understanding one's BMR is pivotal for anyone looking to manage their weight, whether the goal is weight loss, gain, or maintenance. Since BMR accounts for the majority of an individual's calorie expenditure
						(approximately 60-75%), knowing this figure can help tailor dietary intake and exercise plans more effectively. For instance, someone looking to lose weight would aim to consume fewer calories than their total daily
						energy expenditure, of which BMR is a significant component. Conversely, gaining weight might require consuming more calories than one expends throughout the day.
					</p>
					<p>
						The calculation of BMR is influenced by several factors, including age, sex, weight, and height. Generally, muscle mass consumes more energy than fat, meaning individuals with higher muscle mass have higher BMRs.
						This is why sex and weight play crucial roles in determining BMR, as males typically have a higher percentage of muscle mass compared to females. Age is another critical factor; as one ages, muscle mass tends to
						decrease, leading to a gradual decline in BMR. Height is included in BMR calculations because it's indicative of the body's overall mass and energy needs.
