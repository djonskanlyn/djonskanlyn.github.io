Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Website

The main purpose of this website is to explain what the BMR is; this is facilitated through a youtube video and a wikipedia page with links on the home page.

There is another webpage that facilitates the calculation of a person's BMR given their gender, age, height and weight as inputs.

The newsletter page displays the website's monthly newsletter and facilitates people to signup to the newsletter mailing list by submitting their name and e-mail address.

The website can be accessed here: https://djonskanlyn.github.io
